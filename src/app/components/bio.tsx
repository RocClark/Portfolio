          Hello my name is Roscoe I Have been learning about web development
          over the course of the last few years and am looking to get into the
          tech world.I enjoy learning about new technologies and like working
          with others to expand my knowledge and see things from different
          points of view. I am based out of Nashua New Hampshire, and am looking
          to joint a team within the relative area. I like learning new
          technology . My favorite part of web dev is working on the front end,
          and have enjoyed learning about bootstrap and tailwind.css.
